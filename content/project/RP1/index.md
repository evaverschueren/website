<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
It is generally said that out-of-the-money call options are expensive and one can ask the
question from which moneyness level this is the case. Expensive actually means that the price one
pays for the option is more than the discounted average payoff one receives. If so, the option bears a
negative risk premium. The objective of this paper is to investigate the zero-risk premium moneyness
level of a European call option, i.e., the strike where expectations on the optionâ€™s payoff in both the
P- and Q-world are equal. To fully exploit the insights of the option market we deploy the Tilted
Bilateral Gamma pricing model to jointly estimate the physical and pricing measure from option
prices. We illustrate the proposed pricing strategy on the option surface of stock indices, assessing
the stability and position of the zero-risk premium strike of a European call option. With small
fluctuations around a slightly in-the-money level, on average, the zero-risk premium strike appears
to follow a rather stable pattern over time. </p>
